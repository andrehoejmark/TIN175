As it turns out some computers/IDEs use different path variables, this file
was added to address the issue when the python source folder is not set to
the 'src' folder, and instead uses the root Git folder. So you should be able
to launch the 'RNN_wheather_prediction.py' file using either this 'start.py'
script or executing 'RNN_wheather_prediction.py' directly. Use whichever does
not crash.
